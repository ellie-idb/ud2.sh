# 0xcc.pw
This repo hosts the source code for [0xcc.pw](https://0xcc.pw).

Please note: I have no clue where the typist library came from. 
It's sat on my hard drive for years, and I've finally come to use it.

As well: the VM data is not included. This is intentional -- ask me (contact info on website) for a copy (but youll likely want to build your own image!)
